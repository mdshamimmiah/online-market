my five project feature:

1. Visually Appealing Design: The website should have an attractive and visually appealing design with a focus on color contrast, proper alignment, and spacing. It should stand out as a unique project and not resemble any previous assignments or practice projects.

Navbar and Footer on Every Page: The website should have a consistent navbar and footer on all pages, except the 404-page. The footer should include essential elements like the website logo and name, copyright information, contact details, social media links, and address.

2. User Authentication (Login & Registration): The website should implement a user authentication system, with login and registration pages. Users should be able to log in using their email and password, and there should also be the option for Google Sign-in. Relevant error messages should be displayed when necessary.

3. Home Page with Dynamic Content: The home page should feature a banner section with a carousel, allowing users to browse through relevant images. It should also include a tab-based system for browsing jobs in different categories, such as web development, digital marketing, and graphics design. The job data will be retrieved from a MongoDB database, and users can add job data from the Add Job page.

4. Job Details Page and Bidding System: When users click on the "Bid Now" button on a job card, they should be redirected to the job details page. This page will display information about the job, including the job name, deadline, price range, and a description. Users can place their bids by entering their bidding amount and a deadline. Once a bid is placed, it will be stored in a MongoDB database, and a toast notification will be shown. Users cannot bid on their own job postings.

5. These are some of the core features of the website as per the provided requirements. The website should also include additional features like user profile pages, managing posted jobs, managing bid requests, a 404-page, and private routes with JWT authentication. It's important to follow the guidelines provided, such as using environment variables for sensitive data, creating meaningful Git commits, and making the website responsive for different devices.
